Stateflow is a graphical modeling environment that is used to design and simulate logic based on time-based events or external signals. Logical systems are state machines. 
While Simulink can model continuous changes in a dynamic system, Stateflow models instantaneous changes in dynamic systems.
# State Machine
- The operating modes of a machine are states. For example, ON/OFF for a switch.
- Active state is the current state of the machine.
- State machines are machines with a set of predefined states where only one exist at a time.
- Certain conditions must be satisfied for state transition. This is visualized using a state-transition diagram.
- Box represents state and arrows indicate transition.
- Current state of the system can vary based on the previous state and variables.
