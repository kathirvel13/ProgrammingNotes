# Introduction

**RDBMS** - Relational Database Management System
SQL is used to create, modify and retrieve data from a relational database. A database is said to be relational if two or more its tables are connected via common fields/attributes.
Database stores data in the form of tables (consisting of rows and columns/attributes/fields).
